project Name: codeRex kanban


Descriptions step by step: 

1. Create the project:
   - Start by setting up a new React project with Vite to build a Kanban board application.

2. Folder structure:
   - Organize the project with a clear folder structure for components and Redux-related files. Create separate folders for components and the Redux store.

3. Create Header and KanbanBody components:
   - Begin building the user interface by creating the Header component, which will serve as the top navigation bar.
   - Create the KanbanBody component, which will be the main section of the Kanban board.

4. Create Button and TaskModal components:
   - Inside the Header component, add a button that will open the TaskModal component when clicked. The TaskModal will be a popup/modal where users can add new tasks.

5. TaskModal requirements:
   - Within the TaskModal component, design a form that includes input fields for the task title, description (textarea), and due date (input type date).

6. Redux Toolkit environment:
   - Set up the Redux store using Redux Toolkit. Configure the store with necessary middleware, like `redux-thunk`, to handle asynchronous actions.

7. AddTask boardSlice:
   - Create a Redux slice named `boardSlice.js` to handle the state of the Kanban board. Define an initial state that includes demo JSON data for tasks and columns.

8. Integrate data into the KanbanBody:
   - In the KanbanBody component, connect to the Redux store to retrieve the data and display it on the Kanban board. Make sure to update the UI whenever the state changes using Redux DevTools.

9. Implement addTask action:
   - Within the `boardSlice.js`, create an `addTask` action that allows users to add new tasks to the board. Generate a unique ID for each task to avoid conflicts.

10. Remove task data:
    - Implement a function in the `boardSlice.js` to remove a specific task based on its ID. Update the state in the Redux store accordingly.

11. Update task data:
    - Create a function in the `boardSlice.js` to update task data logically based on the previous data. This ensures that new data is set correctly without overwriting existing information.

12. Test drag-and-drop API:
    - Implement the `onDrag`, `dragOver`, and `dragStart` web API functions to enable drag-and-drop functionality for tasks. This allows users to move tasks between different columns on the Kanban board.

Remember to thoroughly test your application at each step and add error handling to ensure a smooth user experience. Following these steps will help you build a working Kanban board application using React, Vite, and Redux Toolkit. Happy development!
